Composite model to explore both cardinal and serial bias simultaniously. 
Current model works... 
Want to explore how optimal parameters change when:
- uncertainty is scalled with width of sensory estimate
- effect on absolute error when input stimuli match expected stimuli vs. oppose it
	- in both distribution and
	- sequence order

Models for cardinal bias adapted from Taylor&Bays 2018 
Models for serial bias adapted from vanBergen&Jehee 2019
